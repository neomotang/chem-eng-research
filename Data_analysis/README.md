# General data analysis

---

## Overview
A number of scripts used for various data analyses are included in this folder. Examples of uses are a double-interpolation to get the appropriate pressure correction at a calibrated temperature (Interpolate.bas), revising Excel formulas in multiple cells across different tabs en masse (TBC), and performing least squared & absolute deviation regression (TBC).

## Tools Used
- `Excel VBA`: Used for the double-interpolation, and also revising Excel formulas (TBC).
- `MATLAB`: Used for the least squares & absolute deviation regression (TBC).
