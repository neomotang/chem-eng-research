# Modelling semi-batch reaction kinetics using conductivity and FTIR spectroscopy measurements

---

## Overview
This project focuses on modelling the kinetics of the aqueous reaction of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and monoethanolamine (MEA). Experiments were conducted in a semi-batch reactor, where a solution of MEA and water was pumped into a reactor containing CO<sub>2</sub> predissolved in water. A range of temperatures and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were investigated, and the reaction was initially monitored using conductivity. The conductivity measurements were used to regress rate constants corresponding to two reaction mechanisms: zwitterion and termolecular mechanism. Results were published in an internal report (Motang, 2012).

Similar experiments were performed in a follow-up project where the reaction was monitored using FTIR spectroscopy. The results were published in a Masters thesis (Motang, 2015) (http://hdl.handle.net/10019.1/96903).

## Tools Used
- `MATLAB`: Used for solving ODEs to regress rate constants and then create plots of experimental vs. predicted data.
