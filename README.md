# Chemical Engineering research projects - Stellenbosch University
This repository is a collection of programming projects developed during my research studies (undergraduate/honours, masters and PhD) in Chemical Engineering at Stellenbosch University (2012 - 2024). The code showcases some of the interesting applications I had of programming, such as solving ODEs to model reaction kinetics, controlling a signal generator and an oscillscope via USB to measure viscosity, and automating analysis of experimental laboratory data contained in 100s of .csv files.

## Contents 

- **Modelling semi-batch reaction kinetics using conductivity and FTIR spectroscopy measurements**  
  Using `MATLAB` to solve ODEs and regress rate constants for selected reaction mechanisms.

- **Determining viscosity of mixtures from the resonant frequency of a quartz crystal**  
  Using `Python` to control the PicoScope 2206B and measure response voltage at various frequencies. The data, saved as .csv, is analysed with a `VBA` script to get the resonant frequency of the quartz crystal and thereafter the fluid mixture's viscosity.

- **General data analysis**  
  More generic tools to help with data analysis and processing, e.g. using `VBA` to create a custom function for double-interpolation within `MS Excel`, performing least squares & absolute deviation regression in `MATLAB`, using `VBA` to bulk edit formulas in cells across multiple tabs in `MS Excel`, etc.
