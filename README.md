The MATLAB code in this repository was used to analyse experimental data for research projects towards BEng (December, 2012) and MEng (December, 2014) 
qualifications in Chemical Engineering from Stellenbosch University.

For both projects, expressions for reaction rate equations were regressed on experimental semi-batch kinetics data.
The aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) - carbon dioxide reaction was under investigation.

BEng (December, 2012) project:
- MEAfittingzwit.m - based on the zwitterion reaction mechanism; conductivity was used to monitor the reaction rate progression
- MEAfittingterm.m - based on the termolecular reaction mechanism; conductivity was used to monitor the reaction rate progression

MEng (December, 2014) project:
